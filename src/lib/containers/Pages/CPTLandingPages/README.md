# CPT LANDING PAGES

For each custom post type we define a landing page.

We have the default landing page, which just displays the post_title and the post_content in a default template, but for some CPTs we need to add a bit extra (literature needs the pdf link, video should show the video etc).

All custom CPT landing pages should compose the default one, just adding their own extra content.

Note: Product and Application Gallery have more specific specialised landing pages. These can be found in apps/Bradley/Pages
